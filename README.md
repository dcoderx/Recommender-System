# Recommender-System #
A recommender system that suggests movies according to ratings from various users.


## Abstract
Recommender systems are machine learning-based systems that scan through all possible options and provides a prediction or recommendation. However, building a recommendation system has the below complications: Users' data is interchangeable.

## System Requirements
Memory and disk space required per user: 1GB RAM + 1GB of disk + .5 CPU core.
Server overhead: 2-4GB or 10% system overhead (whatever is larger), .5 CPU cores, 10GB disk space.
Port requirements: Port 8000 plus 5 unique, random ports per notebook.

## Installation
You can find the installation documentation for the
[Jupyter platform, on ReadTheDocs](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).
The documentation for advanced usage of Jupyter notebook can be found
[here](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

For a local installation, make sure you have
[pip installed](https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installing/) and run:

    $ pip install notebook 
    
 In the event that you do not have python installed, it could be installed locally by running :
 
    $ pip install python
   
 Other system requirements to execute this project are : Numpy , Pandas, Matplotlib and seaborn.
 All of which can be installed locally using pip . i.e :
    
    $ pip install numpy
    $ pip install pandas
    $ pip install matplotlib
    $ pip install seaborn

## Usage - Running Jupyter notebook

### Running in a local installation

Launch with:

    $ jupyter notebook

### Running in a remote installation

You need some configuration before starting Jupyter notebook remotely. See [Running a notebook server](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/public_server.html).

## Development Installation

See [`CONTRIBUTING.rst`](CONTRIBUTING.rst) for how to set up a local development installation.

## Execution of project
